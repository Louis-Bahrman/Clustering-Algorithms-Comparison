# Clustering Algorithms Comparison to prioritize humanitarian aid
Comparison of several clustering algorithms in order to classify countries by need of humanitarian aid

This project was divided in 2 parts, a comparison of the performance of several algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical, Gaussian, DBSCAN) and their parameters for different "shapes" of clusters, and the application of some of these methods to select 10 countries needing humanitarian aid.
